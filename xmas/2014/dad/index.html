            <p>Dad,</p>
        </div>
        <div class='content white c02'>
            <p>Use the following symbol to continue.</p>
        </div>
        <div class='content c03'>
            <p>The great thing about developing your own Christmas cards is that you can customize each and every one.</p>
        </div>
        <div class='content c04'>
            <p>I thought that it would be smart to make them digital this year – if you recall I hand-made a small batch last year.</p>
        </div>
        <div class='content c05'>
            <p>The list of folks who deserve well-wishes has grown substantially this time around, and I figured I'd play to my strengths in order to maintain a timely distribution.</p>
        </div>
        <div class='content c06'>
            <p>Besides, everyone deserves a little holiday cheer.</p>
        </div>
        <div class='content c07'>
            <p>To be completely honest, while writing this I had every intention of coming up with something debonair and witty to say, but the truth is that I don't think I have it in me.</p>
        </div>
        <div class='content c08'>
            <p>I think all I have to say is thanks for being my dad.</p>
        </div>
        <div class='content c09'>
            <p>I've done a lot of growing up over the last year – most of which you haven't had the opportunity to see.</p>
        </div>
        <div class='content c10'>
            <p>I've learned a whole bunch of new lessons and put a lot of them into action. I live a completely different life.</p>
        </div>
        <div class='content c11'>
            <p>Not surprisingly, a lot of what you told me when I was little came back to bite me in the butt.</p>
        </div>
        <div class='content c12'>
            <p>I learned that if I try hard enough, I can succeed. Not only do I succeed, but I excel.</p>
        </div>
        <div class='content c13'>
            <p>I also think it's important to note that you've helped me out quite a bit financially this year.</p>
        </div>
        <div class='content c14'>
            <p>It's been a tough year, and I know I've been a little reckless. I'm trying to improve, I promise.</p>
        </div>
        <div class='content c15'>
            <p>All this to say that I really appreciate having you here to watch my back.</p>
        </div>
        <div class='content c16'>
            <p>I'm not so little anymore. I'm living my own life. I have a career. In the end however, it's nice to know you're here.</p>
        </div>
        <div class='content c17'>
            <p>(I swear I didn't mean for that to rhyme.)</p>
        </div>
        <div class='content c18'>
            <p>So I hope you have a happy Christmas; I know we don't have much under the tree, but I'd by lying if I said I needed anything more than to just be here.</p>
        </div>
        <div class='content c19'>
            <p>I appreciate my time at home with you and Jonathon more and more as time goes on.</p>
        </div>
        <div class='content c20'>
            <p>Merry Christmas <span>dad</span>.</p>
